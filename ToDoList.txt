# Things Needed for This Version

1. have an adaptable binwidth to samplesize for histogram and find a way to select the whole bar.

2 switch to buttons instead of click functionality

3. fix the select plot functionality when drawBoot is triggered more than once.

4. remove accumulative functionality âœ“
  ##Hopefully will fix the selecting plot issue in #3. **It didnt
  
5. Have rstudio select a random plot for "..." instead of just having a "..." 

6. add text/ titles to the example page.

7. add confidence interval/standard error.


# Ideas for Future Development

##Not happening ##
1. Maybe add Clicker function to plot the sample that generated the selected dot on the dotplot(similar to latest bootsrap plot).
  *Concerns: 
  - geom_dotplot changing dot size depending on number and     distribution.
  - Tried making dotplot with geom_point (FAILED).
  - Finding data of each bootstrapped sample stored.
##############


2. Maybe try to find a way to animate the process.


### Can I change to bootstrapping simulations
