# Ideas for Future Development
1. Maybe add Clicker function to plot the sample that generated the selected dot on the dotplot(similar to latest bootsrap plot).
  *Concerns: - geom_dotplot changing dot size depending on number and distribution.
             - Tried making dotplot with geom_point (FAILED).
             - Finding data of each bootstrapped sample stored.
             
2. Maybe try to find a way to animate the process.
